### What I learned

I started this challenge at the beginning of the year in order to learn how to layout a website using CSS/SCSS.<br/>
..no, it didn't take 11 months to finish it. :wink: I'm just sharing it now as I was occupied with other projects.<br/><br/>
While solving the challenge it was important to me to understand the concept and benefits of Flexbox and CSS Grid<br/>
as well as making the website work on different devices (moblile, desktop and everything in between).<br/>
I also made myself familiar with CSS transitions and animations to enhance the user experience of the website.<br/><br/>
But I ended up trying out more techniques e.g. Webpack, ESLint and building components<br/>
like a carousell or a contact form with a basic form validation, which I could use for my personal website.
